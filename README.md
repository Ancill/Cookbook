## The Cookbook Method

This is some kind of idea, making all handy tips and code snippets in one place, it's brings some of your tools really come closer to your hands.
Original idea of it comes from * https://github.com/DevDungeon/Cookbook


### Benefits of Building Your Own Cookbook

* You can share it with others
* Learn topics that are interesting to you
* You build up your knowledge in small increments
* You can see your progress over time
* You have a library of reference material in your own style.
* It is quicker than looking up documentation or looking for a Stack Overflow answer.
* Explore new topics
* Learn new programming languages.
* Tips for Building a Cookbook
* Store your cookbook in a version control system like Git.
* Keep a to do list of topics or programming languages you want to explore and learn
* It does not have to be just code. I have a lot of plain text .txt files with notes on things like how to create a Python pip package, creating Ruby Gems, or how to create a runnable JAR in Java. Sometimes tips on installing prerequisites if something was difficult or just notes on how to compile and run programs.
* It can also be template programs. For example I have a base chrome browser extension that doesn't really do anything itself, but it is a fully functional extension with all the boilerplate done and ready for me to start developing.
* Programs should be fully runnable and not just chunks of code without context that do not compile and execute
* Keep the snippets small, simple and to one topic

### Example Cookbook Topics

Everyone has different goals with programming so identify topics relevant to your interests. Here are some ideas if you do not know where to get started.

* Hello, world
* Getting user input from stdin
* Taking command line arguments
* Reading and writing files
* Using TCP sockets
* Making HTTP requests
* Parsing JSON
* Creating a CSV file
* Making database connections
* Playing an audio file
* Multithreading
* Drawing 2D graphics to screen
* Drawing 3D graphics to screen
* GUI programming
